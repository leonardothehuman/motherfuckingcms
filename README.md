<h1>This is a motherfucking website.</h1>
<p>And is powered by the Mother***king CMS</p>
<h3>Seriously, you guys think that a fucking website are only static HTML?</h3>
<p>WRONG, do you really think that you will never update your website, but when you have to add a single page, you waste your entire week updating the fucking menu on all fucking pages !!!</p>
<h3>Let-me explain to you, little motherfucker, why this is the best motherfucking website</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Shit's still lightweight and loads fast, really, this shit will not get significantly heavier just because you have added some fucking css, in fact, the css of this fucking website is smaller than this shitty text.</li>
    <li>Still Fits on all your shitty screens, even on your shitty hardcore linux terminal.</li>
     <li>Uses a font that any asshole has on the computer, and any asshole with a fucking slow device don't have to wait 5 fucking seconds because the shitty browser is loading your faggot's favorite font</li>
     <li>It have pages, really, how many fucking sites do you visite that has only one single shitty page?</li>
<li>It has a menu, so you don't have do manually update all fucking files on the server because of your stupid typo when you was fucking drunk</li>
</ul>
<h3>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
<p>You are over-loading your server, do you really think you need almost 10Mb of php files and more than 200 fucking hooks just to render a fucking page of your fucking kittens? no, you need a lightweight 47kb php file that builds your page and deliver your fucking html the more lightweight way possible!</p>
<h3>It's responsive.</h3>
<p>Look at this side menu, it can take you anywhere, now, resize the fucking window, where are the menu now?, you don't need that stupidity of placing the menu always on top just because it looks better on any faggot's phone, the menu will always better adapt to your screen, and will be at the side of your fucking monochromatic ambar monitor when the windo is big. (Unless if you are a fucking dinossaur using a browser without media query support)</p>
<h3>It enhaces.</h3>
<p>Dare you to resize this shit, you see , the shitty menu will be collapsed at the top, stick your fucking finger on the top and the menu fucking expands, now disable your shytty javascript and reload this shit, the shitty menu will always be expanded now, and this piece of shit can be browsed even you are afraid that NSA use javascript exploits to jail you because of the pictures on that hidden directory.</p>
<h3>The admin page enhaces.</h3>
<div>Try to update your shitty website with a text mode web browser !!!, can you ? not? this motherfucking website can be update on any browser, even if you don't have cookies, are on a fucking terminal, but it enhaces to a beautifull wysiwyg editor on ie5+.</div>
<h3>It fucking works</h3>
<p>Look at all this shit, you can read it, all this shytty content was visible from the very beggining, you don't have to scroll 42,195km just to read the shitty content.</p>
<h3>This is a website, not a one page ad on a toilet paper, try to go to the other pages ...</h3>
<p>Dare you to click on a menu item, go ahead, the CMS will take care of loading the next shitty page that must be sent to your fucking device.</p>
<h4>Yes, this is fucking satire, you fuck</h4>
<p>I just wanted to build something that works on any browser, so I built this shit that can be forked on GitHub...</p>
